This is the public site for the paper under submission named: "Using k-mer embedding as effective feature representation for building 
a cross-species prediction model to identify DNA N6-Methyladenine sites in plant genomes"

LIBRARY REQUIREMENTS
	We will need to install some basic packages to run the programs as followed:
		git version 2.15.1.windows.2
		python 3.6.5
		numpy 1.14.3
		pandas 0.23.0
		sklearn 0.20.2


INSTRUCTION:

1. Using git bash to clone all the required files in "YOUR FOLDER" folder git clone https://github.com/khucnam/Meta-i6mA

2. python Predict.py your_fasta_file.fasta ("your_fasta_file.fasta" file contains the sequences you want to classify. Please see the "sample.fasta" as an example.)

----> Running the Predict.py script will generate the Result.txt file.
